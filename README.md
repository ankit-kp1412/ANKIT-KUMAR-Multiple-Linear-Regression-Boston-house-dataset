# ANKIT-KUMAR-Multiple-Linear-Regression-Boston-house-dataset

ðŸŽ¯ **Objective:**

>The objective of this assignment is to develop a multiple linear regression model using the provided dataset to predict a target variable based on multiple features. Go through the complete process of data preparation, model training, evaluation, and result visualization.

**Tasks:**

>Load the dataset and inspect its structure, including the data types, summary statistics, and the first few rows of the dataset.

>Identify the features and target variable in the dataset.

>Select multiple features to be used as predictors for the target variable.

>split the data into training and testing sets (80-20 split).

>Implement a multiple linear regression model using Python and Scikit-learn.

>Train the model on the training dataset.

>Use the trained model to make predictions on the test dataset.

>Visualize the actual vs. predicted values for one of the selected features.

>Create a scatter plot showing the relationship between the feature and the target variable, highlighting both actual and predicted values.

>Write a brief report summarizing the model's performance, insights gained from the evaluation metrics, and the effectiveness of the selected features in predicting the target variable.
